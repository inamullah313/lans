      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Sheikh Inamullahâ€”a passionate web developer and coding enthusiast. My journey began with an interest in creating meaningful digital experiences, and I've been honing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java ever since.

        I specialize in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. Currently, I'm working on creating impactful landing pages and plan to dive deeper into web development and full-stack technologies. My goal is to merge creativity and functionality to deliver exceptional web solutions.
        
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy solving complex problems, exploring the depths of technology, and continuously learning to improve my craft. Feel free to connect with me to collaborate or just to say hello!<p>
